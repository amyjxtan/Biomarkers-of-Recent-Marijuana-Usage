# Biomarkers of Recent Marijuana Usage
Amy Tan, Xuan Jiang, Jiawei Lyu


## Project Overview
This project investigates improved biomarkers for marijuana use, aiming to identify more accurate and reliable indicators through statistical and computational analyses. By leveraging advanced statistical methods and domain knowledge, this project explores relationships and patterns in data to propose biomarkers that are better suited for identifying marijuana use.

## Installation and Setup

### Codes and Resources Used
- **Editor Used:** RStudio
- **R Version:** R 4.x.x
- **R Packages Used:**
  - **Data Manipulation:** `dplyr`, `tidyr`
  - **Data Visualization:** `ggplot2`, `plotly`
  - **Statistical Analysis:** `lme4`, `stats`
  - **Others:** `knitr`, `rmarkdown`

### Prerequisites
- Install R and RStudio from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) or a similar repository.
- Install required packages by running the following in your R console:
  ```R
  install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "plotly", "lme4", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))
  ```

### Running the Code
- Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio.
- Run the code chunks sequentially to replicate the analysis and visualize results.

## Data
The data used in this project are located in the `data` folder. It was provided as part of the COGS 137 course by [Dr. Shannon Ellis](https://shannon-ellis.com/).

## Results and Evaluation
The analysis identifies specific biomarkers showing significant correlation with marijuana use, highlighting their potential for diagnostic purposes. Visualization and statistical summaries are provided in the output, emphasizing:
- Key trends and relationships.
- Statistically significant biomarkers.

## Future Work
- Extend the analysis to include larger and more diverse datasets.
- Explore machine learning methods to validate and enhance biomarker identification.
- Investigate longitudinal data to assess biomarkers' stability over time.
